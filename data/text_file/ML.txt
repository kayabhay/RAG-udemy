Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Unlike traditional programming, where rules are coded manually, ML allows systems to improve automatically through experience. The process involves providing data to a model, which identifies patterns and relationships, then using the model to make predictions on new data. ML is generally divided into three types: supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data; unsupervised learning, where it identifies patterns in unlabeled data; and reinforcement learning, where it learns through trial and error to maximize rewards. Key concepts include features (inputs), labels (outputs), models, training, and testing. Machine Learning is widely used across industries to solve complex problems efficiently.
