NLP usually stands for Natural Language Processing.

It’s a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language (text or speech).

What NLP is used for

You’ve probably already used NLP without realizing it:

Chatbots & voice assistants (like Siri or ChatGPT)

Spam filters in email

Autocorrect & grammar checkers

Translation apps (e.g., Google Translate)

Search engines

Sentiment analysis (detecting emotions in text)

What NLP tries to do

NLP combines linguistics + computer science + machine learning to handle tasks like:

Understanding meaning of sentences

Recognizing names, places, dates

Answering questions

Summarizing text

Converting speech ↔ text

Simple example

Text: “I’m feeling sick today.”
NLP can:

Detect the topic (health)

Detect sentiment (negative)

Trigger a helpful response or recommendation
